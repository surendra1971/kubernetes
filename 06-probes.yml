# Probes in kubernetes are typically health checks
# Health Checks are of 3 types on kubernetes 
  # 1) Liveliness Probes : Many applications running for long periods of time eventually transition to broken states, and cannot recover except by being restarted. Kubernetes provides liveness probes to detect and remedy such situations. 
  # 2) Readiness Probes  : Once the pod comes up, traffic will only be sent if the POD is ready to accept the traffic. 
  # 3) Startup Probes    :
