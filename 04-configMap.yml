# A Configmap is holder of environment variables which can be injected to any of the kubernetes resources.
# Usually values that are common across the applications will be placed in a configMap and will be used inside the pods.
# To use configMap, we would use envFrom.
# ConfigMap's are only used to handle non-sensiteve values only.
# If you want to inject userName , Password, Token, you need to use another type of resource called as secrets.
